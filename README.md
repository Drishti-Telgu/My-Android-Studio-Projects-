# My-Android-Studio-Projects-
This repository contains a collection of Android app development projects built using Android Studio and Jetpack Compose, created as part of my coursework and self-learning during my time studying in Australia.

Each project reflects hands-on experience with UI design, Composables, layouts, and applying core Kotlin programming concepts. These mini-apps helped me understand how to build real-world interfaces, use images and texts effectively, and structure an Android app using modern tools and best practices.
