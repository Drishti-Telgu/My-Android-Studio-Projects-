# My-Android-Studio-Projects-
This is a mobile application developed using Android Studio as part of my coursework in Australia. It includes features like activity navigation, button-based interactions, and user input handling using Java and XML. The app was designed with a focus on UI/UX and Android development fundamentals. Screenshots and outputs are included for reference.
