This project was built as part of my Android development coursework to demonstrate the implementation of basic input handling, conditional logic, and real-time result display in a mobile app.

The app allows users to:
	•	Input their income
	•	Calculate tax based on predefined slabs
	•	View tax output instantly with a clean UI using Jetpack Compose

Tools Used: Android Studio, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose

Assets Included:
	•	Code file in PDF format
	•	Assignment explanation document (Word/PDF)
	•	A demo video showcasing the app functionality
